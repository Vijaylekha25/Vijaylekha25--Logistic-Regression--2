    "# Purpose of grid search CV in machine learning and how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Purpose: Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is used to systematically search for the optimal hyperparameters of a machine learning model. It helps in finding the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Working: Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation. The performance metric (such as accuracy, F1-score, etc.) is computed for each combination, and the combination that yields the best performance is selected."

    "1.Grid Search CV: Grid search CV exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified in a grid. It is computationally expensive but guarantees finding the optimal combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Randomized Search CV: Randomized search CV randomly samples hyperparameter values from specified distributions. It allows for a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space, especially when the search space is large. While it may not guarantee finding the optimal combination, it often discovers good combinations in less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Choosing between them: Grid search CV is suitable when the hyperparameter search space is small and computationally feasible to explore exhaustively. Randomized search CV is preferred when the search space is large and computational resources are limited."
